# VA 266


## Title

*As a user, I want a user who is signed in to only be able to vote once, so that they cant spam the vote*

## Description

In this user story we want to have it so that when a user is not logged in they cannot vote more than once on a given device.
This will make it so that a user cannot continusly vote on one poll and sway the vote in their favor.

### Details:

1. When a user goes to cast a vote wether they are logged in or not they will have their ip logged in the case vote
2. If a user goes to cast a vote again when they have already have one submitted they will be taken back to the access a vote page

## Acceptance Criteria
    Given I am on the Cast a Vote Page
    And I have not cast a vote yet
    I will be able to cast a vote

    Given I am on the Cast a Vote Page
    And I have cast a vote 
    I will not be able to cast a vote
