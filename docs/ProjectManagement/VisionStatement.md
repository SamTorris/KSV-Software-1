# Vision Statement

The Voting App is a .net mvc web app that allows groups of people to hold a vote through the app in such a way that the vote cannot be swayed by things like peer/social pressure, and allow the vote to be anonymous. Some benefits of this app are the ability to create a vote in the app for a group and have it be anonymous or non-anonymous, be able to support different types and voting like round robin and multiple choice, and to allow the person that created the vote to see analytics of the vote to see how it was distributed via graphs and percentages. We think that this app would be useful in scenarios where a vote needs to be taken in a group, but there is the possibility of the vote being influenced by an outside party. One competitor to this is Loomio though they donâ€™t support multiple kinds of voting and their product costs money where this app would be free for basic users.
