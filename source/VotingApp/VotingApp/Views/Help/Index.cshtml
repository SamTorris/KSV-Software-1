				<strong> Let's say I want to create a simple yes/no poll to ask my friends if they want to go to the movies on Friday or not. </strong>
						<ol>
							<li>First I will pick a title (this can be something simple and short to give an idea what this is about), so I enter "Movies with friends" for my title.</li>
							<li>Then I fill out a description (For this I want to give my friends more information about what they are voting on and when the vote will end), so I enter: "I want everyone to go to the movies
								this Friday at 8pm. Choose yes if you can make it. Choose no if you can't come. The vote will end this Thursday at 8pm so make sure to answer before then." </li>
							<li>Next I choose the poll type: yes/no.</li>
							<li>Then I will choose if I would like it to be anonymous. For this poll I want to know who is coming to the movies on Friday.
						        So I don't check the anonymous box because then I won't be able to see who said no and who said yes. </li>
							<li>Since I am quickly trying to create a poll, I don't check the private option because I don't care who see's the poll.</li>
							<li>I want the poll to close on Thursday at 8pm, so I will choose that for the poll closing time (and pick my time zone - PST).</li>
							<li>I'll then hit the "Review" button so I am able to make sure everything I picked looks good. If I need to make changes on anything I'll hit the "Edit" button which will bring me back to the previous screen to make changes.</li>
							<li>I will now see the voting options that my users will pick from (since it's a yes/no poll I should just see yes and no as the options). If everything looks good and I am ready to send out my vote I'll hit the submit button.</li>

							<li>Next I choose the multiple selection poll option.</li>
							<li>Then I choose if I would like it to be anonymous. For this I told my staff it would be anonymous so I will check the anonymous button. This way I can still see the results, but not how individuals voted. </li>
							<li>I will then choose to have the vote close on Tues. Nov 8 at 3pm since that is right before our next meeting. I will choose PST as well. </li>

				<strong>Multi-round polls are polls that have three or more vote options; the idea behind a multi-round poll is that it should be used in cases where the winning option needs to have a clear majority of the vote. After each round of a multi-round poll closes, the app will analyze the distribution of votes; there are five possible outcomes:</strong> 
					<ol>
						<li>No votes were submitted, in which case the vote creator will be notified by email.</li>
						<li>There was a tie between all the vote options (they all received the same number of votes), in which case, the vote creator will be notified of the tie.</li>
						<li>There was one option that had a clear majority of the votes (greater than 50%), in which case the vote creator will be notified of the winner.</li>
						<li>No option had the majority, but the two options with the least number of votes were tied with the same number of votes, in which case the vote creator will be notified that there isn’t a clear vote option that can be dropped.</li>
						<li>No option had the majority, but there was one option that had a smaller percentage of the votes than all the others. In this case, another round of voting will automatically be generated, with the same vote options as the previous round minus the vote option with the least number of votes from the previous round.</li>
