Feature: VA59

**As a user I want to be able to create a multi-round vote, so voters can narrow down options**

This user story is about adding the capability of creating multi-round votes that will allow the number of vote options to be narrowed 
down with each round of voting. This may help voters decide on a final option, when there are many to begin with.

We will want to add another vote type option to the Create A Vote page. Currently there are two options: Yes/No and Multiple Choice.
The multi-round option will be "Multiple Choice Multi-Round Vote".

If a vote creator chooses "Multiple Choice Multi-Round Vote", then the minimum number of vote options will be three.
