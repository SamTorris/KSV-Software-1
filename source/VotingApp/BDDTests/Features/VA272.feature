**As a user I would like to see an About page so that I can get more information about the app and who created it**

This user story is for adding an About page that contains information about the Opiniony voting app. It will include:

--A description of the reason for the project, dates and place: Western Oregon University, CS 460, CS 461, and CS 462 
Software Engineering I, II and III, Senior Capstone course, etc. --All team members names with links to your Git repos
and optionally LinkedIn --A link to your project's Git repository

	
Scenario: User is able to see a About page
	Given I click on the About link
    Then I will see the page title About Opiniony
